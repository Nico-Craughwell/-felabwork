		<p> The environment is everything around us—trees, rivers, animals, air, and even the people. 
		    It gives us life and supports all living things on Earth. 
			Without a clean and healthy environment, life wouldn’t be possible. 
		    That’s why it’s important for every one of us to understand and protect it. </p>
